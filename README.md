# multithreading-benchmark
This is a project that benchmarks the performance of executing tasks on a single thread vs multiple threads. Tasks, such as sorting strings in a matrix, are benchmarked using varying numbers of threads to compare single-threaded vs multithreaded approaches.



## Available Benchmark Tasks
Currently, multithreading-benchmark supports benchmarking tasks such as sorting strings in a matrix. In the future, additional benchmark tasks may be added to further compare single-threaded vs multithreaded performance.

## Installation
To use the current version of multithreading-benchmark, clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/doganes1507/multithreading-benchmark.git

In the future, .exe files may be added to make it easier to download and use the application.

## Usage
Currently, benchmarks can be interacted with using the console application. In the future, a graphical user interface (GUI) via Windows Forms may be added to make interacting with the benchmarks easier.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute to multithreading-benchmark, feel free to open a pull request or issue on the GitHub repository.
